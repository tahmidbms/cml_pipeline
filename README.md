# cml_pipeline

The project is a natural language processing (NLP) multi class classifier problem of predicting tags for a given description. 

## Use Cases:
1. We want a classifier which can predict a statement or a question, if it is about Python language by tagging it.
2. We want a classifier which can predict category and sub categories of a product based on it's description.
3. We want a classifier which can identify if a given input defines a product or a statement.

## What am I trying?
1. Implement a classification experimentation platform using Github, CML, DVC using Python 3.x
2. Setup a Data Version Control where multiple users can collaborate on Model training, testing, evaluating precision without any need for programing
3. Ensemble multiple models from training to predict classifications on the go
4. ...
